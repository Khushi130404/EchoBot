# EchoBot

This code is an implementation of a simple chatbot using TensorFlow, which is a machine learning framework developed by Google. The chatbot is trained using a neural network to classify user inputs into predefined intents and provide appropriate responses based on the detected intent. The intents.json file is the data that we will provide to our chatbot

## Features
- Intent Classification : Categorizes user input into predefined intents.
- Customizable Responses : Provides responses tailored to each intent.
- Interactive Learning : Easily train the chatbot with additional data.

## Project Structure
- intents.json: Contains the predefined intents, including sample inputs and responses.
- chatbot.py : Main Python script for training and running the chatbot.
- requirements.txt : List of required Python libraries.
- words.pkl : Trained neural network model.
